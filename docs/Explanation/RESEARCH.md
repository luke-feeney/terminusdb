## Data Engineering Lifecycle

TerminusDB came out of a European research project on data engineering
lifecycles. This culminated in the first version of TerminusDB as well
as a book on [Engineering Agile Big-Data Systems](https://www.riverpublishers.com/research_details.php?book_id=659).

## Succinct Datastructures

TerminusDB utilises some novel approaches to Database architecture
which encorporate succinct data-structures. You can find more about
our representation of graphs in [Succinct Data Structures and Delta Encoding for Modern Databases](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-server/blob/master/docs/whitepaper/terminusdb.pdf).
