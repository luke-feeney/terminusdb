# TerminusDB Console

The TerminusDB Console is a ReactJS application that provides users with an interface for managing and querying TerminusDB. TerminusDB Console is included when you run TerminusDB, so you wonâ€™t normally need to run this on your own unless you are a developer of TerminusDB.

TerminusDB Server references this from the index page served when you access the Console from the built in webserver, on ``http://127.0.0.1:6363/`` by default.
