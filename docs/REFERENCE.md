# Reference

This section is designed to help you understand TerminusDB and TerminusHub. It is normally consumed while in ‘doing’ mode.

What matters here is technical description of the machinary so you can work out what to do while you are working. It should be consistent and austere. This is not the place for discussion of problems or conceptual explanations.

We use the ['The documentation system'](https://documentation.divio.com/) to organise the TerminusDB' docs.
