# TerminusDB Roadmap

TerminusDB is a graph database that also works as a document store.

In rough order of priority we've outlined the following features that we hope to implement. If you've an interest in working on one of these features that would be fantastic - get in touch

We have vaguely divided the tasks into "Now", "Next", and "Later" depending on when we plan to work on them. However this should not discourage people from working on our future priorities now!

## Now

## Next

## Later
