## Tutorials

Tutorials, as you can probably guess, are about learning how to use TerminusDB and Hub. They are to be consumed when in learning mode and usually at the beginning of your TerminusDB and Hub journey. There will also be more complex tutorials, but they are not the norm.

The idea is to provide you with a guide that you can repeat exactly. It should give the early user confidence to take further steps. Tutorials should have the minimum necessary descriptions and focus on teaching a small number of important things per tutorial.

We are always trying to improve so let us know if this section could be better. We want your tutorial, so make it and we will publish.

There is also a [tutorial repo]((https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb-tutorials) - check it out for more examples

We use the ['The documentation system'](https://documentation.divio.com/) to organise the TerminusDB docs.
