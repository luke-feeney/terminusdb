# Explanation

This section is designed to help you understand TerminusDB and TerminusHub. It is normally consumed while in ‘learning’ mode.

What matters here is context, explanation, examples built into broader text, suggestions of alternative approaches, connections to different topics. This is not the place for instructions or technical descriptions.

We are always trying to improve, so let us know if the content can be better or if you have a contribution.

We use the ['The documentation system'](https://documentation.divio.com/) to organise the TerminusDB docs.
