We use this structure: https://documentation.divio.com/

All docs must be: Tutorial, How-To, Explanation, or Reference - nothing that mashes them together will be considered! 

**What's missing**
Tell us the doc you need to solve a particular problem

**Give us the title of the doc**
Is it a tutorial, a how-to, an explanation or a reference dac?
